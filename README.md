# Generative Art
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/beldougie/generative-art.svg?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/beldougie/generative-art)

## Overview
This package is based on an article at
[Rectangle World](http://rectangleworld.com/blog/archives/462) that describes a
method of creating artwork using fractal lines and the `<canvas>` element.

The algorithms defined here are not my own work. Full credit belongs to [RectangleWorld.com](http://rectangleworld.com)

## Demo
The git repository contains a demo app that has examples of how to use the library in your own applications.

The demo app will be expanded as the library grows to provide more functionality.
